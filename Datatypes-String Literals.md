# Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign a variable named `men_stepped_on_the_moon`.
2. Use `input()` to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
3. Print the value stored in the variable.

## ðŸ§¾ Program:
```
# Reading a string from the user
user_input = input("Enter a string: ")

# Printing the entered string
print(f"You entered: {user_input}")
```

## Output:
```
Input                  Result
Hello, Python!      Hello, Python!
```
## Result:
thus the program for read and print of strings was successful
